# Python Data Analysis and Visualization ðŸ“Š

This repository is dedicated to Python code and examples focusing on basic data analysis and visualization.

## Overview ðŸ“‹

The main objective of this repository is to explore the capabilities of Python in data analysis and visualization. Key components of this project include:

- **Data Analysis**: Done through Python's "Pandas" library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly is the library chosen, being used to create the graphics (aka 'plots').

## Features ðŸš€

- **Excel**: Spreadsheet used as a local database, containing the info used for the graphics generation.
- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based platform for writing, running, and sharing Python code, serving as an easy way to generate the intended graphs.
- **Pandas**: A versatile library for data manipulation and analysis, indispensable for any data-related task in Python.
- **Plotly**: This library offers a wide range of visualization options, allowing us to create static and interactive graphics that effectively communicate insights from the data.
