# Data Analysis and Visualization Project in Python üìä

This is the synthesis of Alura's course on Data Analysis using Excel formulas, as well as containing Python code and examples of how to perform such analysis and generate graphics using some of the main libraries available in the Python language.

## Overview & Libs üìã

The goal of this project is to explore data analysis and visualization techniques using Python, with a focus on generating graphics. The main libraries used in this project are:

- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is often used in conjunction with Matplotlib to prepare and visualize data sets.
- **Matplotlib**: A widely used library for creating graphics in Python. It offers a wide variety of graph styles and customization options.
- **mplfinance**: For those who enjoy financial analysis, this library is top-notch.
- **yfinance**: To fetch data from the Yahoo Finance API. Very useful for those who are into the stock market.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive and stylish graphics.
- **Prophet**: Used for predicting data based on a given dataframe.

## Features üí≠

- **Data Analysis**: We take the data and have a look to understand what's going on.
- **Graphics Generation**: Then, we create some cool graphics to visualize this data in an easier-to-understand way.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: We even dare to predict the future with some time series models using the Prophet library!

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone this repository**: Get all the code for yourself and bring it to your own computer.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed. Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Explore the Notebooks**: Take a look at the included Jupyter notebooks for examples of how to use these libraries as well as imagery for the graphs!
