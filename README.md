# Data Forecasting and Visualization with Prophet ðŸ“ˆ

This repository is dedicated to Python code and examples focusing on data forecasting and visualization, with a special emphasis on using the Prophet library for time series forecasting.

## Overview ðŸ“‹

The main objective of this repository is to contain the notes for the 5th, and final, class of the course on data analysis, showing the capabilities of Python in data forecasting and visualization, particularly with the Prophet library. Key components of this project include:

- **Data Forecasting**: Done through the Prophet library for Python, used primarily for time series forecasting, enabling future trends and patterns prediction in any data.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Python's Matplotlib to create the graphics, helping the understanding and communication of the insights got from the forecasted data.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Prophet**: A library developed by Facebook for time series forecasting. It offers an easy-to-use interface and powerful capabilities for modeling and predicting time series data.
- **Pandas**: A versatile library for data manipulation and analysis, indispensable for preparing data for forecasting.
- **Matplotlib**: A widely used library for creating graphics in Python, ideal for visualizing forecasted data and trends.
